{#
This Twig template redirects the user to the main "diffbase" section of the Craft CMS Control Panel.

Usage:
- This template is typically used as a placeholder or entry point for the plugin's settings page.
- When accessed, it automatically redirects the user to the "diffbase" route.

Notes:
- Ensure that the "diffbase" route is properly defined in your plugin's `src/controllers/CpController.php`.
- This template does not render any content; it only performs a redirect.
